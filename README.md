        vars:
          foo: bar    
```

## Plugins

Plugins are implemented using the [go plugin over RPC](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) package.

Plugins are triggered using the `--plugin` flag. They are executed with the `vars` set with the `--var` flag and the global `vars` property in the `.run.yml` file.

### Example: 

See [`plugin.go`](/examples/plugin.go) for an example.

## Development

The goal is that `run` is build and maintained by itself. However, up until this very moment. There two quick steps to build it.

The development is intended to be run with [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) the blazing fast cloud developer environment.

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on goreleaser release --snapshot --rm-dist
```
